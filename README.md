# n3 ASCII art rendering

ASCII art represents a group of graphic design techniques that produce images from printable characters. It originated in its modern form in times when printers had limited graphical capabilities and transferring images over computer networks was inappropriate due to bandwidth constraints. It has its value as an interesting reminder of graphical expression on early computer interfaces.

This git repository contains two approaches to ASCII art rendering: `n3ar` and `n3lar`.
